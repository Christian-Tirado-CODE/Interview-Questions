Linked Lists
Linked lists are a linear collection in which the elements are not necessarily stored
in contiguous memory locations. As a result of this, to maintain their relative order,
 each element in the list has a reference to the next element in the list.
 Each element in a list is typically referred to as a node and contains a specific type
 of object. While Java and other languages offer a linked list library, itâ€™s very common
 during interviews to use custom node classes to store data as you please.

What to Know for Interviews
Linked lists are a common topic during technical interviews questions,
most of which involve traversing the list and returning a specific element,
 or modifying the list itself. Because of this, knowing how to traverse a linked list
  is paramount to being able to solve these questions. When traversing a linked list,
   the only reference you have to start is the head (or beginning) of the list.
   From the head you must continue traversing while you have not encountered a
   null node (i.e. the end of the list).
