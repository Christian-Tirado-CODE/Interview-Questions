Strings, What are they?
In programming, strings are data types that store sequences of characters. 
Depending on the language you’re using, strings may or may not be immutable. 
In Java specifically, strings are immutable. This is to help ensure things like
security, synchronization, and caching. Because strings are immutable, when you 
modify a string, it creates an entirely new string. This is important to know, 
especially during technical interviews, as repeatedly modifying a string could 
degrade your runtime. If you do need to constantly modify a string during an 
interview question, consider using a StringBuilder, which is mutable.


String Methods to Know for Interviews
Strings are arguably the most commonly used data type throughout programming, 
and as a result, will be used extensively during interviews. Whether the problem 
relates to strings directly and manipulating them, or you simply need to store 
intermediary information to solve the problem at hand, you should familiarize 
yourself with strings and their available methods. Some of the most common 
string methods you’ll use during interviews are the following:

.toCharArray()
.indexOf()
.split()
